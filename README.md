With the help of pattern strategy user have a possibility to create File- or TextEncryptor. I realized some different ways to encrypt text. User can combine some ways in runtime. With File is a little bit harder. In main Folder you should have two text files with names Input and Output. You should insert Text you want to encrypt at file Input.txt, with the help of Encryptor make what you want(En- or Decryption) and then in File Output.txt you will see the result of your requests. For File I added only one way to encrypt data. Also important thing is that user should use private key to decrypt it then in right way.
